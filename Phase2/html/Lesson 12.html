<p>Although there are more triads, we’re only going to talk about one more, for now—the <strong>diminished triad</strong>. To our ears, it’s a little tense or unstable. It feels like it is begging to be resolved (to the Key’s root). It is not very common, but it sometimes adds the perfect touch.</p>
<p>Here’s the technical bit. The actual diminished triad formula is defined as:</p>
<ul>
<li>Root</li>
<li><strong>Minor third</strong> above root: an interval of 3 half steps, W+H. E.g., B to D.</li>
<li><strong>Diminished fifth</strong> above root: an interval of 6 half steps, a minor third + a minor third, (W+H)+(W+H). E.g., B to F.</li>
</ul>
<p>One more time, this definition is very important because it is very precise - it has an important purpose in defining and naming chords. But, for us and for now, we’ll just keep thinking of it as the stacked thirds.</p>
<pre><code>1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8   9   10  11  12  13  14  15
C   D   E   F   G   A   B   C   D   E   F   G   A   B   C
                        ^       ^       ^
</code></pre>
<p>If you were playing a song in the key of C, you would only find this one diminished triad (and not very often):</p>
<pre><code>B diminished: B - D - F
</code></pre>
<p>When a diminished triad appears on a chord chart, it may appear with various chord quality decorations: Cdim, C°</p>
<p>When we talk about a diminished triad according to scale degrees, we would call it a 1-♭3-♭5 (or, 1-3♭-5♭ - people say it both ways). (Remember - these numbers are scale degrees from the major scale of the root of the chord.)</p>
<h3 id="definitions">Definitions</h3>
<dl>
<dt>Diminished Fifth</dt>
<dd>Interval of six half steps (tritone), creating dissonance and tension (e.g., B to F).</dd>
<dt>Key</dt>
<dd>Refers to the tonal center or scale upon which a musical composition is primarily based. It establishes the tonic (the central note) and defines the set of pitches, intervals, and chords that predominate in the piece, providing a sense of hierarchy, resolution, and harmonic framework.</dd>
<dt>Minor Third</dt>
<dd>Interval of three half steps (one whole and one half), producing a somber, narrow sound (e.g., A to C).</dd>
<dt>Scale</dt>
<dd>An ordered sequence of notes, typically spanning an octave, arranged in ascending or descending order according to a specific pattern of intervals (whole steps and half steps, or tones and semitones). It serves as the foundational pitch collection for melodies, harmonies, and improvisation within a musical composition or tradition.</dd>
<dt>Third</dt>
<dd>An interval of three or four half steps (minor or major third) spanning the first, second, and third scale degrees or equivalent.</dd>
<dt>Triad</dt>
<dd>A three-note chord consisting of a root, third, and fifth, forming the basic building block of harmony.</dd>
