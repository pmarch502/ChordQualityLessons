<p>Now that we know about notes, scales, and keys, we can start talking about <strong>chords</strong>. Chords are the foundation of harmony in music—they’re what make songs feel full and supportive under melodies or vocals in worship.</p>
<p>It is common for people to talk about “singing harmony”. What they usually mean is something like performing vocal parts that complement the melody by singing different pitches that create richness or fullness. That is definitely harmony.</p>
<p>We rarely think of the chords that make up a song as harmony. If two guitar players are talking on stage about a new song, you will probably hear one of them say, “what are the chords?” You probably won’t hear one of them say, “what’s the harmony?” We don’t need to change the way we talk, but we do need to recognize that the chords of a song are true and classic harmony.</p>
<p>But, we’re still left with our question - what is a chord? A chord is simply a group of notes played together. Specifically, we’re going to (first) focus on <strong>triads</strong>, which are chords made of <strong>three notes stacked in thirds</strong>. Wow, that escalated quickly. (For what it’s worth, two notes (the infamous power chord or a 5, e.g. C5) is technically just an interval or dyad.)</p>
<p>What does “stacked in thirds” mean? Let’s go back to our C major scale. If you start from any note (we’ll call that the chord’s root and how we’ll name the chord), you skip every other note in the scale to build up a triad. Here’s that C major scale with some notes highlighted:</p>
<pre><code>1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
C   D   E   F   G   A   B   C
^       ^       ^
</code></pre>
<p>Start on C (the root). Skip D to land on E (a third from C). Skip F to land on G (a third from E). Boom—that’s a C triad: <strong>C - E - G</strong>.</p>
<pre><code>1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
C   D   E   F   G   A   B   C
    ^       ^       ^
</code></pre>
<p>This is how all of the basic triads of any key/scale are built. Let’s start on D (the root). Skip E to land on F (a third from D). Skip G to land on A (a third from F). Boom—that’s a Dm triad: <strong>D - F - A</strong>.</p>
<p>So, a C triad is just another way of saying C chord. A Dm triad is just another way of saying Dm chord. Triads are the most basic chords. Without even breaking a sweat, you’ve just figured out two of the chords that are in the Key of C. (If you continued this exercise, you could figure out the other five triads in the key of C.)</p>
<h3 id="definitions">Definitions</h3>
<dl>
<dt>Chord</dt>
<dd>The simultaneous sounding of three or more distinct pitches (notes), typically arranged in stacked intervals (most commonly thirds), forming a harmonic unit that provides vertical structure and support within a musical composition.</dd>
<dt>Harmony</dt>
<dd>The simultaneous combination of tones, particularly the use of chords and their progression, to create a structured and pleasing vertical aspect of music. It contrasts with melody (horizontal succession of notes) and rhythm (temporal organization).</dd>
<dt>Interval</dt>
<dd>The distance in pitch between two notes. This distance is measured both quantitatively (by the number of scale steps or semitones) and qualitatively (by the specific sound or character of the interval).</dd>
<dt>Key</dt>
<dd>Refers to the tonal center or scale upon which a musical composition is primarily based. It establishes the tonic (the central note) and defines the set of pitches, intervals, and chords that predominate in the piece, providing a sense of hierarchy, resolution, and harmonic framework.</dd>
<dt>Note</dt>
<dd>A fundamental unit representing a single musical sound with specific characteristics. It encompasses both the acoustic properties of the sound and its symbolic representation in notation.</dd>
<dt>Root</dt>
<dd>The foundational note of a chord upon which the other notes are built, defining the chord’s name and function; typically the lowest note in root position.</dd>
<dt>Third</dt>
<dd>An interval of three or four half steps (minor or major third) spanning the first, second, and third scale degrees or equivalent.</dd>
<dt>Triad</dt>
<dd>A three-note chord consisting of a root, third, and fifth, forming the basic building block of harmony.</dd>
