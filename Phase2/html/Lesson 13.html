<p>In any key (scale), triads can be built on each scale degree. Again, we can do this with any key (scale), but let’s keep using the key of C major (C major scale) so we can see the pattern.</p>
<p>Here are all of the triads:</p>
<pre><code>     C major:  C   D   E   F   G   A   B   C
               ^       ^       ^
     D minor:  C   D   E   F   G   A   B   C
                   ^       ^       ^
     E minor:  C   D   E   F   G   A   B   C
                       ^       ^       ^
     F major:  C   D   E   F   G   A   B   C
                           ^       ^       ^
     G major:  C   D   E   F   G   A   B   C   D
                               ^       ^       ^
     A minor:  C   D   E   F   G   A   B   C   D   E
                                   ^       ^       ^
B diminished:  C   D   E   F   G   A   B   C   D   E   F
                                       ^       ^       ^

<p>These are sometimes expressed as Roman numerals where uppercase=Major, and lowercase=minor:</p>
<pre><code>I       ii      iii     IV      V       vi      vii°
C maj   D min   E min   F maj   G maj   A min   B dim
</code></pre>
<p>Or, even in our common Arabic numerals (popularly known as the Nashville Number System):</p>
<pre><code>1       2       3       4       5       6       7
C maj   D min   E min   F maj   G maj   A min   B dim
</code></pre>
<p>FYI - With Arabic numerals, there isn’t a standard way to write them. Some will simply write a ‘2’ and expect the reader to know that it is representing a minor triad. Others will write ‘2m’ to be explicit and remove any chance for confusion.</p>
<h3 id="definitions">Definitions</h3>
<dl>
<dt>Diatonic</dt>
<dd>Pertaining to the notes or chords that naturally belong to a specific key or scale, derived directly from its scale degrees without chromatic alteration.</dd>
<dt>Key</dt>
<dd>Refers to the tonal center or scale upon which a musical composition is primarily based. It establishes the tonic (the central note) and defines the set of pitches, intervals, and chords that predominate in the piece, providing a sense of hierarchy, resolution, and harmonic framework.</dd>
<dt>Nashville Number System</dt>
<dd>A method of notating chord progressions using Arabic numerals (1, 2, 3, etc.) to represent the scale degrees on which chords are built, relative to the key of the song.</dd>
<dt>Roman Numeral Analysis</dt>
<dd>A system of labeling chords by their scale degree function using Roman numerals (uppercase for major, lowercase for minor).</dd>
<dt>Scale</dt>
<dd>An ordered sequence of notes, typically spanning an octave, arranged in ascending or descending order according to a specific pattern of intervals (whole steps and half steps, or tones and semitones). It serves as the foundational pitch collection for melodies, harmonies, and improvisation within a musical composition or tradition.</dd>
<dt>Scale Degree</dt>
<dd>The position of a note within a given scale, numbered sequentially from the tonic (the first note) upward to the octave.</dd>
<dt>Triad</dt>
<dd>A three-note chord consisting of a root, third, and fifth, forming the basic building block of harmony.</dd>
