<p>Next on our tour of misfit triads, we have the <strong>Suspended 4 triad</strong>. To our ears, it might sound open, floating, ambiguous, and unresolved. Unlike the diminished and augmented triads, it is quite common. It often adds the perfect touch of tension to bring excitement to a chord progression. When used, it most commonly soon resolves to its major counterpart, e.g. Csus4 - C.</p>
<p>Here’s the technical bit. The actual augmented triad formula is defined as:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Perfect fourth</strong> above root: an interval of 5 half steps, W+W+H. E.g., C to F.</li>
<li><strong>Perfect fifth</strong> above root: an interval of 7 half steps, a major third + a minor third, (W+W)+(W+H). E.g., C to G.</li>
</ul>
<p>This triad does fit nicely into the key (scale) like most of our previous triads have. However, it doesn’t fit well with the idea of stacking thirds. I mean, how did that fourth get in there? The suspended triads are more about <strong>replacing</strong> the third. For example, in a C major triad (C - E - G) we want to replace the E. In a suspended 4, we replace the third (E) with the fourth (F).</p>
<p>Here is one example of a suspended 4 triad:</p>
<pre><code>C suspended 4: C - F - G

1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
C   D   E   F   G   A   B   C
^           ^   ^
</code></pre>
<p>When a suspended 4 triad appears on a chord chart, it may appear with various chord quality decorations: Csus4, Csus, C4</p>
<p>When we talk about a suspended 4 triad according to scale degrees, we would call it a 1-4-5. (Remember - these numbers are scale degrees from the major scale of the root of the chord.)</p>
<h3 id="definitions">Definitions</h3>
<dl>
<dt>Key</dt>
<dd>Refers to the tonal center or scale upon which a musical composition is primarily based. It establishes the tonic (the central note) and defines the set of pitches, intervals, and chords that predominate in the piece, providing a sense of hierarchy, resolution, and harmonic framework.</dd>
<dt>Perfect Fourth</dt>
<dd>Interval of five half steps with a numeric size of a fourth, classified as perfect due to its consonant, stable, and acoustically pure quality.</dd>
<dt>Perfect Fifth</dt>
<dd>Interval of seven half steps, providing stability and consonance (e.g., C to G).</dd>
<dt>Scale</dt>
<dd>An ordered sequence of notes, typically spanning an octave, arranged in ascending or descending order according to a specific pattern of intervals (whole steps and half steps, or tones and semitones). It serves as the foundational pitch collection for melodies, harmonies, and improvisation within a musical composition or tradition.</dd>
<dt>Third</dt>
<dd>An interval of three or four half steps (minor or major third) spanning the first, second, and third scale degrees or equivalent.</dd>
<dt>Triad</dt>
<dd>A three-note chord consisting of a root, third, and fifth, forming the basic building block of harmony.</dd>
