<p>Since we’ve got that major triad under our belts, let’s continue and talk about the <strong>minor triad</strong>. To our ears, it’s a little sad or introspective. It is also pretty common, but more often used as complement or spice as opposed to the main “feel”.</p>
<p>Here’s the technical bit. The actual minor triad formula is defined as:</p>
<ul>
<li>Root</li>
<li><strong>Minor third</strong> above root: an interval of 3 half steps, W+H. E.g., D to F.</li>
<li><strong>Perfect fifth</strong> above root: an interval of 7 half steps, a major third + a minor third, (W+W)+(W+H). E.g., D to A.</li>
</ul>
<p>Again, this definition is very important because it is very precise - it has an important purpose in defining and naming chords. But, for us and for now, we’ll just keep thinking of it as the stacked thirds.</p>
<pre><code>C   D   E   F   G   A   B   C
    ^       ^       ^
</code></pre>
<p>If you were playing a song in the key of C, you would find that these minor triads were very common:</p>
<pre><code>D minor: D - F - A
E minor: E - G - B
A minor: A - C - E
</code></pre>
<p>When a minor triad appears on a chord chart, it may appear with various chord quality decorations: Cm, Cmi, Cmin, C-</p>
<h3 id="definitions">Definitions</h3>
<dl>
<dt>Key</dt>
<dd>Refers to the tonal center or scale upon which a musical composition is primarily based. It establishes the tonic (the central note) and defines the set of pitches, intervals, and chords that predominate in the piece, providing a sense of hierarchy, resolution, and harmonic framework.</dd>
<dt>Minor Third</dt>
<dd>Interval of three half steps (one whole and one half), producing a somber, narrow sound (e.g., A to C).</dd>
<dt>Perfect Fifth</dt>
<dd>Interval of seven half steps, providing stability and consonance (e.g., C to G).</dd>
<dt>Scale</dt>
<dd>An ordered sequence of notes, typically spanning an octave, arranged in ascending or descending order according to a specific pattern of intervals (whole steps and half steps, or tones and semitones). It serves as the foundational pitch collection for melodies, harmonies, and improvisation within a musical composition or tradition.</dd>
<dt>Third</dt>
<dd>An interval of three or four half steps (minor or major third) spanning the first, second, and third scale degrees or equivalent.</dd>
<dt>Triad</dt>
<dd>A three-note chord consisting of a root, third, and fifth, forming the basic building block of harmony.</dd>
