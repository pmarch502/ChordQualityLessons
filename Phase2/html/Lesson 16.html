<p>As our last stop on our tour of misfit triads, we have the <strong>Suspended 2 triad</strong>. To our ears, it might sound open, neutral, dreamy, floating, and ambiguous - but, it doesn’t have an unresolved quality (like suspended 4). Like the suspended 4 triad, it is quite common. It often adds the perfect touch of color to bring excitement to a chord progression.</p>
<p>Here’s the technical bit. The actual augmented triad formula is defined as:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Major second</strong> above root: an interval of 2 half steps, W. E.g., C to D.</li>
<li><strong>Perfect fifth</strong> above root: an interval of 7 half steps, a major third + a minor third, (W+W)+(W+H). E.g., C to G.</li>
</ul>
<p>Like the suspended 4 triad, this triad does fit nicely into the key (scale) like most of our previous triads have. Additionally, it doesn’t fit well with the idea of stacking thirds. I mean, how did that second get in there? The suspended triads are more about <strong>replacing</strong> the third. For example, in a C major triad (C - E - G) we want to replace the E. In a suspended 2, we replace the third (E) with the second (D).</p>
<p>Here is one example of a suspended 2 triad:</p>
<pre><code>C suspended 2: C - D - G

1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
C   D   E   F   G   A   B   C
^   ^           ^
</code></pre>
<p>When a suspended 2 triad appears on a chord chart, it may appear with various chord quality decorations: Csus2, C2</p>
<p>When we talk about a suspended 2 triad according to scale degrees, we would call it a 1-2-5. (Remember - these numbers are scale degrees from the major scale of the root of the chord.)</p>
<h3 id="definitions">Definitions</h3>
<dl>
<dt>Key</dt>
<dd>Refers to the tonal center or scale upon which a musical composition is primarily based. It establishes the tonic (the central note) and defines the set of pitches, intervals, and chords that predominate in the piece, providing a sense of hierarchy, resolution, and harmonic framework.</dd>
<dt>Major Second</dt>
<dd>Interval of two half steps with a numeric size of a second, classified as major due to its wider, brighter quality compared to the minor second.</dd>
<dt>Perfect Fifth</dt>
<dd>Interval of seven half steps, providing stability and consonance (e.g., C to G).</dd>
<dt>Scale</dt>
<dd>An ordered sequence of notes, typically spanning an octave, arranged in ascending or descending order according to a specific pattern of intervals (whole steps and half steps, or tones and semitones). It serves as the foundational pitch collection for melodies, harmonies, and improvisation within a musical composition or tradition.</dd>
<dt>Third</dt>
<dd>An interval of three or four half steps (minor or major third) spanning the first, second, and third scale degrees or equivalent.</dd>
<dt>Triad</dt>
<dd>A three-note chord consisting of a root, third, and fifth, forming the basic building block of harmony.</dd>
