<p>We’ve looked at all of the triads that are built from stacking thirds in a scale. However, there are some common triads that exist that don’t neatly fit into that formula. First, we have the <strong>Augmented triad</strong>. To our ears, it might sound symmetrical or unbalanced. Like the diminished triad, it is rare, but when used appropriately, it can be fun or even exotic.</p>
<p>Here’s the technical bit. The actual augmented triad formula is defined as:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Major third</strong> above root: an interval of 4 half steps, W+W. E.g., C to E.</li>
<li><strong>Augmented fifth</strong> above root: an interval of 8 half steps, a major third + a major third, (W+W)+(W+W). E.g., C to G♯.</li>
</ul>
<p>This doesn’t fit as nicely into the key (scale) as all of our previous triads have. I mean, how did that G♯ get in there? The augmented triad is more about the symmetry (a major third + a major third). It’s the complement of a diminished triad (a minor third + a minor third). It is often used to pass between chords: V - Vaug - I, V - Vaug - vi, I - Iaug - vi, IV, IVaug, V.</p>
<p>Here is one example of an augmented triad:</p>
<pre><code>C augmented: C - E - G♯

1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
C   D   E   F   G   A   B   C
^       ^       ♯
</code></pre>
<p>When an augmented triad appears on a chord chart, it may appear with various chord quality decorations: Caug, C+, C+5</p>
<p>When we talk about an augmented triad according to scale degrees, we would call it a 1-3-♯5 (or, 1-3-5♯ - people say it both ways). (Remember - these numbers are scale degrees from the major scale of the root of the chord.)</p>
<h3 id="definitions">Definitions</h3>
<dl>
<dt>Augmented Fifth</dt>
<dd>Interval of eight half steps, creating an unstable, ambiguous sound (e.g., C to G♯).</dd>
<dt>Key</dt>
<dd>Refers to the tonal center or scale upon which a musical composition is primarily based. It establishes the tonic (the central note) and defines the set of pitches, intervals, and chords that predominate in the piece, providing a sense of hierarchy, resolution, and harmonic framework.</dd>
<dt>Major Third</dt>
<dd>Interval of four half steps (two whole steps), producing a bright, open sound (e.g., C to E).</dd>
<dt>Scale</dt>
<dd>An ordered sequence of notes, typically spanning an octave, arranged in ascending or descending order according to a specific pattern of intervals (whole steps and half steps, or tones and semitones). It serves as the foundational pitch collection for melodies, harmonies, and improvisation within a musical composition or tradition.</dd>
<dt>Third</dt>
<dd>An interval of three or four half steps (minor or major third) spanning the first, second, and third scale degrees or equivalent.</dd>
<dt>Triad</dt>
<dd>A three-note chord consisting of a root, third, and fifth, forming the basic building block of harmony.</dd>
