# Lesson 11: Minor Triad

Since we've got that major triad under our belts, let's continue and talk about the **minor triad**. To our ears, it's a little sad or introspective. It is also pretty common, but more often used as complement or spice as opposed to the main "feel".

Here's the technical bit. The actual minor triad formula is defined as:
- Root
- **Minor third** above root: an interval of 3 half steps, W+H. E.g., D to F.
- **Perfect fifth** above root: an interval of 7 half steps, a major third + a minor third, (W+W)+(W+H). E.g., D to A.

Again, this definition is very important because it is very precise - it has an important purpose in defining and naming chords. But, for us and for now, we'll just keep thinking of it as the stacked thirds.

```
1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
C   D   E   F   G   A   B   C
    ^       ^       ^
```

If you were playing a song in the key of C, you would find that these minor triads were very common:
```
D minor: D - F - A
E minor: E - G - B
A minor: A - C - E
```

When a minor triad appears on a chord chart, it may appear with various chord quality decorations: Cm, Cmi, Cmin, C-

When we talk about a minor triad according to scale degrees, we would call it a 1-♭3-5 (or, 1-3♭-5 - people say it both ways). (Remember - these numbers are scale degrees from the major scale of the root of the chord.)



### Definitions
Key
:  Refers to the tonal center or scale upon which a musical composition is primarily based. It establishes the tonic (the central note) and defines the set of pitches, intervals, and chords that predominate in the piece, providing a sense of hierarchy, resolution, and harmonic framework.

Minor Third
: Interval of three half steps (one whole and one half), producing a somber, narrow sound (e.g., A to C).

Perfect Fifth
: Interval of seven half steps, providing stability and consonance (e.g., C to G).

Scale
: An ordered sequence of notes, typically spanning an octave, arranged in ascending or descending order according to a specific pattern of intervals (whole steps and half steps, or tones and semitones). It serves as the foundational pitch collection for melodies, harmonies, and improvisation within a musical composition or tradition.

Third
: An interval of three or four half steps (minor or major third) spanning the first, second, and third scale degrees or equivalent.

Triad
: A three-note chord consisting of a root, third, and fifth, forming the basic building block of harmony.
