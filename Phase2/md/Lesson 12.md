# Lesson 12: Diminished Triad

Although there are more triads, we're only going to talk about one more, for now—the **diminished triad**. To our ears, it's a little tense or unstable. It feels like it is begging to be resolved (to the Key's root). It is not very common, but it sometimes adds the perfect touch.

Here's the technical bit. The actual diminished triad formula is defined as:
- Root
- **Minor third** above root: an interval of 3 half steps, W+H. E.g., B to D.
- **Diminished fifth** above root: an interval of 6 half steps, a minor third + a minor third, (W+H)+(W+H). E.g., B to F.

One more time, this definition is very important because it is very precise - it has an important purpose in defining and naming chords. But, for us and for now, we'll just keep thinking of it as the stacked thirds.

```
1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8   9   10  11  12  13  14  15
C   D   E   F   G   A   B   C   D   E   F   G   A   B   C
                        ^       ^       ^
```

If you were playing a song in the key of C, you would only find this one diminished triad (and not very often):
```
B diminished: B - D - F
```

When a diminished triad appears on a chord chart, it may appear with various chord quality decorations: Cdim, C°

When we talk about a diminished triad according to scale degrees, we would call it a 1-♭3-♭5 (or, 1-3♭-5♭ - people say it both ways). (Remember - these numbers are scale degrees from the major scale of the root of the chord.)




### Definitions
Diminished Fifth
: Interval of six half steps (tritone), creating dissonance and tension (e.g., B to F).

Key
:  Refers to the tonal center or scale upon which a musical composition is primarily based. It establishes the tonic (the central note) and defines the set of pitches, intervals, and chords that predominate in the piece, providing a sense of hierarchy, resolution, and harmonic framework.

Minor Third
: Interval of three half steps (one whole and one half), producing a somber, narrow sound (e.g., A to C).

Scale
: An ordered sequence of notes, typically spanning an octave, arranged in ascending or descending order according to a specific pattern of intervals (whole steps and half steps, or tones and semitones). It serves as the foundational pitch collection for melodies, harmonies, and improvisation within a musical composition or tradition.

Third
: An interval of three or four half steps (minor or major third) spanning the first, second, and third scale degrees or equivalent.

Triad
: A three-note chord consisting of a root, third, and fifth, forming the basic building block of harmony.
