# Lesson 13: The Triads in a Key

In any key (scale), triads can be built on each scale degree. Again, we can do this with any key (scale), but let's keep using the key of C major (C major scale) so we can see the pattern.

Here are all of the triads:

```
     C major:  C   D   E   F   G   A   B   C
               ^       ^       ^
     D minor:  C   D   E   F   G   A   B   C
                   ^       ^       ^
     E minor:  C   D   E   F   G   A   B   C
                       ^       ^       ^
     F major:  C   D   E   F   G   A   B   C
                           ^       ^       ^
     G major:  C   D   E   F   G   A   B   C   D
                               ^       ^       ^
     A minor:  C   D   E   F   G   A   B   C   D   E
                                   ^       ^       ^
B diminished:  C   D   E   F   G   A   B   C   D   E   F
                                       ^       ^       ^
```

These are sometimes expressed as Roman numerals where uppercase=Major, and lowercase=minor:
```
I       ii      iii     IV      V       vi      vii°
C maj   D min   E min   F maj   G maj   A min   B dim
```

Or, even in our common Arabic numerals (popularly known as the Nashville Number System):
```
1       2       3       4       5       6       7
C maj   D min   E min   F maj   G maj   A min   B dim
```

FYI - With Arabic numerals, there isn't a standard way to write them. Some will simply write a '2' and expect the reader to know that it is representing a minor triad. Others will write '2m' to be explicit and remove any chance for confusion.


### Definitions
Diatonic
: Pertaining to the notes or chords that naturally belong to a specific key or scale, derived directly from its scale degrees without chromatic alteration.

Key
:  Refers to the tonal center or scale upon which a musical composition is primarily based. It establishes the tonic (the central note) and defines the set of pitches, intervals, and chords that predominate in the piece, providing a sense of hierarchy, resolution, and harmonic framework.

Nashville Number System
: A method of notating chord progressions using Arabic numerals (1, 2, 3, etc.) to represent the scale degrees on which chords are built, relative to the key of the song.

Roman Numeral Analysis
: A system of labeling chords by their scale degree function using Roman numerals (uppercase for major, lowercase for minor).

Scale
: An ordered sequence of notes, typically spanning an octave, arranged in ascending or descending order according to a specific pattern of intervals (whole steps and half steps, or tones and semitones). It serves as the foundational pitch collection for melodies, harmonies, and improvisation within a musical composition or tradition.

Scale Degree
: The position of a note within a given scale, numbered sequentially from the tonic (the first note) upward to the octave.

Triad
: A three-note chord consisting of a root, third, and fifth, forming the basic building block of harmony.
