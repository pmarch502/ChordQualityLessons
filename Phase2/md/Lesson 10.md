# Lesson 10: Major Triad

So, we know what triads are and how to build them from a scale using stacked thirds. Now, let's build on that—let's talk about the **major triad**. To our ears, it's bright and happy. It is, by far, the most common in pop, rock, worship, etc...

Let's get technical for a moment. The actual major triad formula is defined as:
- Root
- **Major third** above root: an interval of 4 half steps, W+W. E.g., C to E.
- **Perfect fifth** above root: an interval of 7 half steps, a major third + a minor third, (W+W)+(W+H). E.g., C to G.

This definition is very important because it is very precise - it has an important purpose in defining and naming chords. But, for us and for now, we'll just keep thinking of it as the stacked thirds.

```
1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
C   D   E   F   G   A   B   C
^       ^       ^
```
If you were playing a song in the key of C, you would find that these major triads were very common:
```
C major: C - E - G
F major: F - A - C
G major: G - B - D
```
When a major triad appears on a chord chart, it may appear with various chord quality decorations: C, CMaj, Cmaj, CM

When we talk about chords, we sometimes refer to them by scale degrees. We would call a major triad a 1-3-5. (There is something tricky about this. Those numbers are scale degrees from the major scale of the root of the chord - **not** the key/scale the song is in.)


### Definitions
Key
:  Refers to the tonal center or scale upon which a musical composition is primarily based. It establishes the tonic (the central note) and defines the set of pitches, intervals, and chords that predominate in the piece, providing a sense of hierarchy, resolution, and harmonic framework.

Major Third
: Interval of four half steps (two whole steps), producing a bright, open sound (e.g., C to E).

Perfect Fifth
: Interval of seven half steps, providing stability and consonance (e.g., C to G).

Scale
: An ordered sequence of notes, typically spanning an octave, arranged in ascending or descending order according to a specific pattern of intervals (whole steps and half steps, or tones and semitones). It serves as the foundational pitch collection for melodies, harmonies, and improvisation within a musical composition or tradition.

Third
: An interval of three or four half steps (minor or major third) spanning the first, second, and third scale degrees or equivalent.

Triad
: A three-note chord consisting of a root, third, and fifth, forming the basic building block of harmony.
