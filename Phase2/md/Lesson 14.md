# Lesson 14: Augmented Triad

We've looked at all of the triads that are built from stacking thirds in a scale. However, there are some common triads that exist that don't neatly fit into that formula. First, we have the **Augmented triad**. To our ears, it might sound symmetrical or unbalanced. Like the diminished triad, it is rare, but when used appropriately, it can be fun or even exotic.

Here's the technical bit. The actual augmented triad formula is defined as:
- **Major third** above root: an interval of 4 half steps, W+W. E.g., C to E.
- **Augmented fifth** above root: an interval of 8 half steps, a major third + a major third, (W+W)+(W+W). E.g., C to G♯.

This doesn't fit as nicely into the key (scale) as all of our previous triads have. I mean, how did that G♯ get in there? The augmented triad is more about the symmetry (a major third + a major third). It's the complement of a diminished triad (a minor third + a minor third). It is often used to pass between chords: V - Vaug - I, V - Vaug - vi, I - Iaug - vi, IV, IVaug, V. 

Here is one example of an augmented triad:
```
C augmented: C - E - G♯

1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
C   D   E   F   G   A   B   C
^       ^       ♯
```

When an augmented triad appears on a chord chart, it may appear with various chord quality decorations: Caug, C+, C+5

When we talk about an augmented triad according to scale degrees, we would call it a 1-3-5♯ (or, 1-3-5♯ - people say it both ways). (Remember - these numbers are scale degrees from the major scale of the root of the chord.)



### Definitions
Augmented Fifth
: Interval of eight half steps, creating an unstable, ambiguous sound (e.g., C to G♯).

Key
:  Refers to the tonal center or scale upon which a musical composition is primarily based. It establishes the tonic (the central note) and defines the set of pitches, intervals, and chords that predominate in the piece, providing a sense of hierarchy, resolution, and harmonic framework.

Major Third
: Interval of four half steps (two whole steps), producing a bright, open sound (e.g., C to E).

Scale
: An ordered sequence of notes, typically spanning an octave, arranged in ascending or descending order according to a specific pattern of intervals (whole steps and half steps, or tones and semitones). It serves as the foundational pitch collection for melodies, harmonies, and improvisation within a musical composition or tradition.

Third
: An interval of three or four half steps (minor or major third) spanning the first, second, and third scale degrees or equivalent.

Triad
: A three-note chord consisting of a root, third, and fifth, forming the basic building block of harmony.
