<p>When we talk about different notes, we are often interested in how far apart they are. This is referred to as an interval. There is much to know about intervals, but for our purposes at this point, we’re going to focus on a very small part.</p>
<p>We are going to talk about whole steps and half steps. The whole step is represented by a W. The half step is represented by an H (it is also referred to as a semitone). Let’s look again at the list of all twelve tones:</p>
<pre><code>A   A♯/B♭   B   C   C♯/D♭   D   D♯/E♭   E   F   F♯/G♭   G   G♯/A♭
</code></pre>
<p>The ‘distance’ between each of these notes is called a half step. So, from A to A♯ is one half step (H). From A to B is a whole step (W) - i.e. two half steps makes a whole. From E to F is only a half step (H). From E to F♯ is a whole step (W).</p>

<dd>The distance in pitch between two notes, measured both quantitatively (by the number of scale steps or semitones) and qualitatively (by its specific sound and classification, such as major, minor, perfect, augmented, or diminished).</dd>
<dt>Note</dt>
<dd>A fundamental unit representing a single musical sound with specific characteristics. It encompasses both the acoustic properties of the sound and its symbolic representation in notation.</dd>
