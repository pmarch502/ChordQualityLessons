<p>Now that we know what an interval is, you might be wondering what it is used for. They actually have many purposes, but we will focus on using intervals to define a scale. A scale is a subset of the twelve notes used as the foundational pitches for melodies, harmonies, and chords.</p>
<p>The idea is this: by picking a subset of notes, we limit the notes and chords that should be used and this makes for things that always sound good together. We’ll see how this works as we continue through the lessons.</p>
<p>What we are going to focus on is a collection of intervals that represent the major scale - i.e. a formula for making a major scale. You would likely recognize a major scale as the universally recognizable Do, Re, Mi, Fa, So, La, Ti, Do.</p>
<p>The major scale follows this simple formula:</p>
<pre><code>W   W   H   W   W   W   H
</code></pre>
<p>The W stands for a whole step. The H stands for a half step. Let’s look again at the list of all twelve tones:</p>
<pre><code>A   A♯/B♭   B   C   C♯/D♭   D   D♯/E♭   E   F   F♯/G♭   G   G♯/A♭
</code></pre>
<p>The ‘distance’ between each of these notes is called a half step. So, from A to A♯ is one half step (H). From A to B is a whole step (W).</p>
<p>So, how do we define the notes in a scale? First, you pick your starting point. Let’s start with a C major scale. Let’s use our twelve names (imagine it repeats itself forever) and our major scale formula to create the C major scale:</p>
<pre><code>A   A♯/B♭   B   C   C♯/D♭   D   D♯/E♭   E   F   F♯/G♭   G   G♯/A♭
W   W   H   W   W   W   H
</code></pre>
<p>Since this is the C major scale, we’ll start on C. The formula says to go a whole step up for the next note (two half steps). That would be a D. Then, the formula says to go a whole step up again. That would be an E. Then, the formula says to go up a half step. That would be an F. If we go through to the end, it would look like this:</p>
<p>C <sup>+W</sup> D <sup>+W</sup> E <sup>+H</sup> F <sup>+W</sup> G <sup>+W</sup> A <sup>+W</sup> B <sup>+H</sup> C</p>
<p>So, there it is. The C major scale is:</p>
<pre><code>C   D   E   F   G   A   B   C
</code></pre>
<p>This formula could be applied to any starting point. For example, here is the G major scale:</p>
<p>G <sup>+W</sup> A <sup>+W</sup> B <sup>+H</sup> C <sup>+W</sup> D <sup>+W</sup> E <sup>+W</sup> F♯ <sup>+H</sup> G</p>
<p>The G major scale is:</p>
<pre><code>G   A   B   C   D   E   F♯   G
</code></pre>
<h3 id="definitions">Definitions</h3>
<dl>
<dt>Chord</dt>
<dd>The simultaneous sounding of three or more distinct pitches (notes), typically arranged in stacked intervals (most commonly thirds), forming a harmonic unit that provides vertical structure and support within a musical composition.</dd>
<dt>Harmony</dt>
<dd>The simultaneous combination of pitches (notes sounded together) to produce chords and chord progressions, creating vertical structures that support and enrich melody.</dd>
<dt>Interval</dt>
<dd>The distance in pitch between two notes, measured both quantitatively (by the number of scale steps or semitones) and qualitatively (by its specific sound and classification, such as major, minor, perfect, augmented, or diminished).</dd>
<dt>Melody</dt>
<dd>A linear succession of musical notes (pitches) organized in a coherent sequence over time, typically perceived as a single, memorable musical line or phrase. It is distinguished by its rhythmic structure, contour (shape formed by rising and falling pitches), and intervallic relationships.</dd>
<dt>Note</dt>
<dd>A fundamental unit representing a single musical sound with specific characteristics. It encompasses both the acoustic properties of the sound and its symbolic representation in notation.</dd>
<dt>Scale</dt>
<dd>An ordered sequence of notes, typically spanning an octave, arranged in ascending or descending order according to a specific pattern of intervals (whole steps and half steps, or tones and semitones). It serves as the foundational pitch collection for melodies, harmonies, and improvisation within a musical composition or tradition.</dd>
