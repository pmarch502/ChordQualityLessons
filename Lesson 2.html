<p>As we noticed in Lesson 1, there are only seven alphabet letter names - but, there are twelve notes. We also have names for the notes between the <strong>natural</strong> notes. We use the words <strong>sharp</strong> and <strong>flat</strong> (and their corresponding symbols <strong>♯</strong> and <strong>♭</strong>) to name the notes that are in between the alphabet names. For example, there is a note between C and D (if you are familiar with a piano keyboard, it’s one of the black keys). We call that C sharp (C♯). We also call it D flat (D♭). Yep, it has two names. Right now, that probably seems confusing, but there is actually a good reason for it (but, that’ll have to wait). When a note has two different names for the same pitch, we call them enharmonic notes. So, here are all twelve names - the natural and the enharmonic:</p>
<pre><code>A   A♯/B♭   B   C   C♯/D♭   D   D♯/E♭   E   F   F♯/G♭   G   G♯/A♭
</code></pre>

<dt>Enharmonic</dt>
<dd>Two notes, intervals, chords, or keys that are notated differently but produce the identical pitch or set of pitches.</dd>
<dt>Note</dt>
<dd>A fundamental unit representing a single musical sound with specific characteristics. It encompasses both the acoustic properties of the sound and its symbolic representation in notation.</dd>
<dt>Pitch</dt>
<dd>the perceived highness or lowness of a musical sound, primarily determined by the frequency of its sound wave vibrations.</dd>
