<p>You’ve probably heard people say things like “It’s in the key of G” or “It’s in A.” You may even have said things like that, yourself. But, what exactly is a <strong>key</strong> and what does it mean to be in one and why do I care?</p>
<p>First, we should probably talk about <strong>notes</strong>. In modern western music, we use a twelve-tone equal temperament tuning. This means that within a single octave, there are twelve notes or pitches. <em>(On a piano keyboard, an octave is every key from one C up to (or down to), but not including, the next C.)</em> We name them with letters of the alphabet:</p>
<pre><code>A   B   C   D   E   F   G
</code></pre>
<p>You may have noticed, there are only seven names - but, we just said there are twelve notes. This is because the letters, when they appear without any additional information (like a ♯ or a ♭), are referring to <strong>natural</strong> notes. We can identify these, for the most part, with the white keys on a piano. The additional names will be discussed in Lesson 2.</p>

<h3 id="definitions">Definitions</h3>
<dl>
<dt>Key</dt>
<dd>Refers to the tonal center or scale upon which a musical composition is primarily based. It establishes the tonic (the central note) and defines the set of pitches, intervals, and chords that predominate in the piece, providing a sense of hierarchy, resolution, and harmonic framework.</dd>
<dt>Note</dt>
<dd>A fundamental unit representing a single musical sound with specific characteristics. It encompasses both the acoustic properties of the sound and its symbolic representation in notation.</dd>
<dt>Octave</dt>
<dd>The interval between two pitches where the higher pitch has exactly twice the frequency of the lower pitch, resulting in notes that share the same letter name (e.g., C to the next C) but differ in register.</dd>
<dt>Pitch</dt>
<dd>the perceived highness or lowness of a musical sound, primarily determined by the frequency of its sound wave vibrations.</dd>
