<p>We briefly mentioned in Lesson 1 about octaves. In real life, there are a couple things you need to know about them.</p>
<p>First, if you look at a piano keyboard, you will see that the keys are in a repeating pattern: seven white keys with five black keys interspersed within. They are the twelve tones we spoke of in Lesson 1. Each set of twelve tones on the piano keyboard is one octave. (A piano has more than seven octaves! The guitar has, at most, four.)</p>

<p>Second, if you were to play the piano, you would see that each octave (as you move to the right) is higher in pitch than the one preceding it. In fact, in terms of frequency, it is exactly double. Again, to our ears, it just sounds ‘higher’.</p>
<p>We may be asked to play or sing in a different octave, “Hey, can you play that down an octave?”. This simply means, “Can you play that using lower pitches?” The inverse would be true for ‘up an octave’.</p>
<h3 id="definitions">Definitions</h3>
<dl>
<dt>Octave</dt>
<dd>The interval between two pitches where the higher pitch has exactly twice the frequency of the lower pitch, resulting in notes that share the same letter name (e.g., C to the next C) but differ in register.</dd>
<dt>Pitch</dt>
<dd>the perceived highness or lowness of a musical sound, primarily determined by the frequency of its sound wave vibrations.</dd>
