# Lesson 1: Notes A-G
  
You've probably heard people say things like "It's in the key of G" or "It's in A." You may even have said things like that, yourself. But, what exactly is a **key** and what does it mean to be in one and why do I care?

First, we should probably talk about **notes**. In modern western music, we use a twelve-tone equal temperament tuning. This means that within a single octave, there are twelve notes or pitches. *(On a piano keyboard, an octave is every key from one C up to (or down to), but not including, the next C.)* We name them with letters of the alphabet: 
 ```
A   B   C   D   E   F   G
 ```

You may have noticed, there are only seven names - but, we just said there are twelve notes. This is because the letters, when they appear without any additional information (like a ♯ or a ♭), are referring to **natural** notes. We can identify these, for the most part, with the white keys on a piano. The additional names will be discussed in Lesson 2.

### Definitions
Key
:  Refers to the tonal center or scale upon which a musical composition is primarily based. It establishes the tonic (the central note) and defines the set of pitches, intervals, and chords that predominate in the piece, providing a sense of hierarchy, resolution, and harmonic framework.

Note
: A fundamental unit representing a single musical sound with specific characteristics. It encompasses both the acoustic properties of the sound and its symbolic representation in notation.

Octave
: The interval between two pitches where the higher pitch has exactly twice the frequency of the lower pitch, resulting in notes that share the same letter name (e.g., C to the next C) but differ in register.

Pitch
: the perceived highness or lowness of a musical sound, primarily determined by the frequency of its sound wave vibrations.
