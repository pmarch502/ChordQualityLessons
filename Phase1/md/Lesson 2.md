# Lesson 2: Sharps and Flats
  
As we noticed in Lesson 1, there are only seven alphabet letter names - but, there are twelve notes. We also have names for the notes between the **natural** notes. We use the words **sharp** and **flat** (and their corresponding symbols **♯** and **♭**) to name the notes that are in between the alphabet names. For example, there is a note between C and D (if you are familiar with a piano keyboard, it's one of the black keys). We call that C sharp (C♯). We also call it D flat (D♭). Yep, it has two names. Right now, that probably seems confusing, but there is actually a good reason for it (but, that'll have to wait). When a note has two different names for the same pitch, we call them enharmonic notes. So, here are all twelve names - the natural and the enharmonic:
 ```
A   A♯/B♭   B   C   C♯/D♭   D   D♯/E♭   E   F   F♯/G♭   G   G♯/A♭
 ```

### Definitions
Enharmonic
: Two notes, intervals, chords, or keys that are notated differently but produce the identical pitch or set of pitches.

Note
: A fundamental unit representing a single musical sound with specific characteristics. It encompasses both the acoustic properties of the sound and its symbolic representation in notation.

Pitch
: the perceived highness or lowness of a musical sound, primarily determined by the frequency of its sound wave vibrations.
