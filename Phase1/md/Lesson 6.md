# Lesson 6: What Is a Key?
  
When we started Lesson 1, we said: You've probably heard people say things like "It's in the key of G" or "It's in A." You may even say things like that, yourself. But, what exactly is a **key** and what does it mean to be in one and why do I care?

Finally, we are going to be able to answer that question. When we say we are in the key of C, we are saying that the notes and chords we play should all come from the C major scale. *(There are exceptions, but that's a story for another day.)*

If we used our formula and determined that the D major scale is:
 ```
D   E   F♯   G   A   B   C♯   D
 ```
Then, when we say we are in the key of D, we are saying that the notes and chords we play should all come from notes of the D major scale.

If we played an F♯ while in the key of C, it would sound weird, off, bad. But, if we play an F♯ in the key of D, it sounds normal, on, good.

So, we know what all the notes are and we know how we might go about figuring out what subset of those notes are in a key. We could do this for every one of the twelve notes. But, surely someone has done all this work for us, right? Figured out all of the keys? Yes, and we can use a tool that has been around a long time to see them (the tool is good for many additional things, too). The name of this tool won't seem relevant for what we're doing, but it's a good name - you'll just have to trust me. This tool is called the **Circle of Fifths**. Here's what it looks like:

**Wow** - that's kinda scary looking. But, we will only use it for a few points. Without explaining these points (yet), let's just list some things that the Circle of Fifths is telling us. For now, we'll just trust they are true.

- Keys can be represented in a key signature (a shortcut way of defining which notes are sharp or flat - i.e. not natural)
- There are only 15 major keys total (there are relative minor keys, too)
- There is only one major key that has no sharps or flats - C
- There are seven major keys that have sharps
- There are seven major keys that have flats

You might be thinking, "there are only twelve notes, shouldn't there only be 12 keys?" It's a good question. If you look again at the Circle of Fifths, you will notice that some of the keys have two, for example: C♯ and D♭. We talked before about how the same pitch (the same key on the piano) might have two different names - they are enharmonic. Well, we also have enharmonic keys. Just as a note might sound the same, but we call it two different things, the key sounds the same to our ears, but we talk about it in two different ways. If we are in the key of D♭ (one of the flat keys), we refer to the 6th as a B♭m. However, if we are in the key of C♯ (one of the sharp keys), we refer to the 6th as an A♯m. They both have the same notes and they sound the same, but we name them according to the key.



### Definitions
Chord
: The simultaneous sounding of three or more distinct pitches (notes), typically arranged in stacked intervals (most commonly thirds), forming a harmonic unit that provides vertical structure and support within a musical composition.

Key
:  Refers to the tonal center or scale upon which a musical composition is primarily based. It establishes the tonic (the central note) and defines the set of pitches, intervals, and chords that predominate in the piece, providing a sense of hierarchy, resolution, and harmonic framework.

Key Signature
: A set of sharp (♯), flat (♭), or natural (♮) symbols placed at the beginning of a musical staff, immediately after the clef, to indicate which notes are consistently altered throughout the piece unless overridden by accidentals.

Note
: A fundamental unit representing a single musical sound with specific characteristics. It encompasses both the acoustic properties of the sound and its symbolic representation in notation.

Scale
: An ordered sequence of notes, typically spanning an octave, arranged in ascending or descending order according to a specific pattern of intervals (whole steps and half steps, or tones and semitones). It serves as the foundational pitch collection for melodies, harmonies, and improvisation within a musical composition or tradition.
