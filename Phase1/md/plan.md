# Granular Teaching Plan: Chord Mastery for Worship Team (Slow-Paced, Concept-Per-Lesson)

Pace is paramount.  ~40 modular lessons (no fixed weeks; 1 lesson/session, 45-60 min each, 1-2x/week as fits your schedule). This allows 1-2 new ideas max per lesson, with 60% review/practice. Total: 6-12 months at 1/week, or faster. Lessons are self-contained, cumulative: Start with 5-min review quiz, end with mastery check.

### Structure Per Lesson  
- Review (10 min): Quiz prior concepts; reteach if <80% grasp.  
- New Concept (10 min): One simple idea + visual/demo.  
- Practice (20 min): Hands-on (play/sing/ear).  
- Apply (10 min): 1 worship snippet.  
- Homework (5 min assign): 10-15 min daily, next-lesson prep.  

**Tools:** Printable worksheets per lesson (circle of 5ths, chord charts). 
**Future Web App:** Self-paced modules (audio examples, quizzes, piano visualizer)—one lesson per page.

## Phases (Flexible grouping; lessons standalone)  

### Phase 1: Foundations (Lessons 1-8: Notes, Scales, Keys)  

#### Focus: Build note literacy before chords.  

1. Notes A-G: Names, keyboard positions. Practice: Sing/play ascending.  
2. Sharps & Flats: Visual on piano. Practice: ID #/b notes.  
3. Octaves: Pitch repetition. Practice: Play C to high C.  
4. Intervals: Half/Whole Steps: Building blocks. Practice: Sing steps.  
5. Major Scale Formula: W-W-H-W-W-W-H. Practice: C major scale.  
6. What is a Key?: Tonic + scale (e.g., C key = C scale). Practice: Play C scale, feel "home."  
7. 15 Key Signatures: Circle of 5ths intro (sharps side). Practice: ID C/G/D sigs.  
8. 15 Keys Cont.: Flats/enharmonics (F/Bb etc.). Practice: Full wheel; name 5 keys.

### Phase 2: Basic Triads (Lessons 9-16)  

9. Chord = Stacked Thirds: Root + skip. Demo C triad.  
10. Major Triad: Root-M3-P5. Practice: C, F, G.  
11. Minor Triad: Root-m3-P5. Practice: Am, Dm, Em.  
12. Triads in C Key: I (C), IV (F), V (G). Practice: Cycle.  
13. Triads in G Key: G, C, D. Transpose from C.  
14. Diminished Triad: Root-m3-d5 (Bdim). Practice: In C key.  
15. Augmented Triad: Root-M3-A5. Practice: Rare worship use.  
16. Review: All Triads in 3 Keys. Ear ID major/minor.

### Phase 3: Inversions & More Keys (Lessons 17-24)  

17. 1st Inversion: Bass = 3rd. Smooth voice leading.  
18. 2nd Inversion: Bass = 5th. Practice: C/G/Am inversions.  
19. Triads in D/A/E Keys: Guitar-friendly.  
20. Key Sig Reading: Quick ID (e.g., 2 sharps = D).  
21. Relative Minor Keys: Am from C (same sig).  
22. Triads in Bb/F Keys: Flats intro.  
23. Enharmonic Keys: C#/Db feel same, sigs differ.  
24. Mid-Review: Build Triad in Any Key.

### Phase 4: Seventh Chords (Lessons 25-32)  

25. What is a Seventh?: Add interval above triad.  
26. Maj7: Cmaj7. Practice: In C key.  
27. m7: Am7/Dm7.  
28. Dom7 (V7): G7. ii-V7-I practice.  
29. 7ths in C/G Keys: Diatonic set.  
30. m7b5 & Half-Dim: In keys.  
31. Full Dim7: Rare, but complete family.  
32. 7ths Review: Name/Build in 4 Keys.

### Phase 5: Progressions & Diatonic Harmony (Lessons 33-36)  

33. Diatonic Chords: All 7 in a key (I-ii-iii-IV-V-vi-vii°).  
34. Common Progressions: I-IV-V, I-vi-IV-V.  
35. ii-V-I: Backbone of jazz/pop/worship.  
36. Circle of 5ths Progressions: Key changes.

### Phase 6: Extensions & Alterations (Lessons 37-40+)  

37. Sus Chords: Sus4 (G sus4).  
38. Add9: C add9.  
39. 9th Chords: C9 (dom).  
40. Advanced (11/13, #9/b5): As needed; expand if group ready.  
*(Add 10+ more for minors/modal if desired.)*

### Ongoing Mastery Lessons (41+ Ongoing)

- Weekly: Song breakdowns (1 song/lesson), transposition challenges, ear dictation, improv.  
- Monthly Reviews: Full phase quiz.  
- Capstone: "Random Chord Jam"—any root/type/key.

#### Progression Safeguards  
- Pacing Rule: Don't advance if <90% mastery (reteach next lesson).  
- Repetition: Every 4th lesson = pure review.  
- Customization: Skip aug/dim7 if never used; linger on guitar voicings.  
- Metrics: Per lesson: 100% play new concept. Overall: Transpose any progression in 10 keys.  

#### Web App Plan (Tied to Lessons)  
Static site with 40+ pages:  
- Per-lesson interactive (virtual piano, audio play-along, quiz).  
- Key visualizer (animated circle).  
- Progress tracker (unlock lessons).  

This is ultra-granular, digestible—knowledge sticks deeply. Total lessons flexible (add/remove as needed).

#### Clarifying Questions  
- Instruments/Singers Balance: More time on guitar shapes vs. piano voicings? Vocals harmony focus?  
- Session Frequency: 1/week? Bi-weekly? Group size/skill variance?  
- Content Depth: Add minor keys earlier? Specific songs to weave in?  
- App Priority: Build prototype now (e.g., Phase 1 tools)? Or more plan tweaks?  
- Tradeoffs: 40 lessons good start, or expand to 50+ (e.g., per-key drills)?
