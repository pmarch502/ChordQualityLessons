# Lesson 7: Circle of Fifths - Sharps
  
<img src="Circle_of_fifths_deluxe_4.svg" alt="Circle of Fifths" width="500">

At the top of the Circle of Fifths, we have the Key of C. This key is unique because it's the only one with no sharps and no flats. Around the right side of the circle, we have the keys that contain only sharps. *(No key will ever contain sharps **and** flats.)* If this were a clock, the sharps would go clockwise until about 7. When you go clockwise, you are jumping a fifth away - e.g. from C to G is a fifth. That's where the name comes from. *(This may not mean much to you, but it's a good bit of information just the same.)*

You may also notice you are adding a single sharp each time. C has 0, G has 1, D has 2, etc... Here is a little trick for reading a key signature with sharps and quickly determining what the key is. Whatever the rightmost sharp is in the key signature, just add a half step and that is your key. For example, the key signature for the key of G has 1 sharp - F♯. If we add a half-step to F♯, we are at G - the key of the song.

If you take the time to figure it out, you'll notice that there are a few of the enharmonic names that don't get their own key. The names in bold have no associated key:

A | **A♯**/B♭ | B | C | C♯/D♭ | D | **D♯**/E♭ | E | F | F♯/G♭ | G | **G♯**/A♭

The reason goes back to the Circle of Fifths. It has one key with no sharps or flats, seven keys that range from 1 to 7 sharps, and seven keys that range from 1 to 7 flats. These three just don't fit the pattern.



### Definitions
Chord
: The simultaneous sounding of three or more distinct pitches (notes), typically arranged in stacked intervals (most commonly thirds), forming a harmonic unit that provides vertical structure and support within a musical composition.

Key
:  Refers to the tonal center or scale upon which a musical composition is primarily based. It establishes the tonic (the central note) and defines the set of pitches, intervals, and chords that predominate in the piece, providing a sense of hierarchy, resolution, and harmonic framework.

Key Signature
: A set of sharp (♯), flat (♭), or natural (♮) symbols placed at the beginning of a musical staff, immediately after the clef, to indicate which notes are consistently altered throughout the piece unless overridden by accidentals.

Note
: A fundamental unit representing a single musical sound with specific characteristics. It encompasses both the acoustic properties of the sound and its symbolic representation in notation.
