<img src="Circle_of_fifths_deluxe_4.svg" alt="Circle of Fifths" width="500">
<p>Again, at the top of the Circle of Fifths, we have the Key of C. This key is unique because it’s the only one with no sharps and no flats. Around the left side of the circle, we have the keys that contain only flats. <em>(No key will ever contain sharps <strong>and</strong> flats.)</em> If this were a clock, the flats would go counter-clockwise until about 5. When you go counter-clockwise, you are jumping a fourth away - e.g. from C to F is a fourth. <em>(This may not mean much to you, but it’s a good bit of information just the same.)</em></p>
<p>You may also notice you are adding a single flat each time. C has 0, F has 1, B♭ has 2, etc… Here is a little trick for reading a key signature with flats and quickly determining what the key is. First, you just have to memorize F - one flat = key of F. For the rest, whatever the second from the right (i.e. penultimate) flat is in the key signature, that is your key. For example, the key signature for the key of E♭ has 3 flats - B♭, E♭, A♭. Just look at the next to last flat (E♭), that’s the key of the song.</p>
<p>Unlike the sharps, all of the enharmonic flats get their own key. It’s not favoritism, they just happen to fit the pattern.</p>
<p>So, we know how to name the natural notes and the sharps and flats (even as enharmonics). We also know how to construct a major scale from the notes using the major scale formula. And, we know that the notes of a major scale define the notes and chords of a key. That’s a lot of information, but it is foundational for everything we will be doing with chord qualities.</p>
<h3 id="definitions">Definitions</h3>
<dl>
<dt>Chord</dt>
<dd>The simultaneous sounding of three or more distinct pitches (notes), typically arranged in stacked intervals (most commonly thirds), forming a harmonic unit that provides vertical structure and support within a musical composition.</dd>
<dt>Key</dt>
<dd>Refers to the tonal center or scale upon which a musical composition is primarily based. It establishes the tonic (the central note) and defines the set of pitches, intervals, and chords that predominate in the piece, providing a sense of hierarchy, resolution, and harmonic framework.</dd>
<dt>Key Signature</dt>
<dd>A set of sharp (♯), flat (♭), or natural (♮) symbols placed at the beginning of a musical staff, immediately after the clef, to indicate which notes are consistently altered throughout the piece unless overridden by accidentals.</dd>
<dt>Note</dt>
<dd>A fundamental unit representing a single musical sound with specific characteristics. It encompasses both the acoustic properties of the sound and its symbolic representation in notation.</dd>
